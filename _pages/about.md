Hi there, Welcome to my page!  
I'm a 2nd year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo advised by Prof. [Semih Salihoğlu](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~ssalihog/).
I'm fortunate to be supported by the David R. Cheriton Graduate Scholarship. During my PhD, I have interned at 
Microsoft (Gray Systems Lab). My research primarily revolves around [Kùzu](https://kuzudb.com/), which is a Graph 
Database Management System developed in our research group.  

Research 
==========

For my PhD research, I am primarily exploring **_query processing for graph databases_**, with a focus on how modern system
design choices affect performance, scalability, and efficiency. Broadly, I am interested in the intersection of database
internals — including _query processing_, _storage_, _compression_, and _graph data management_.

I am also interested in the applications of graphs in structured / unstructured data management, such as knowledge 
graphs and their role in stateful memory management for agentic systems.

More broadly, my work lies at the intersection of data systems and evolving workloads, where the goal is to understand
how to design future data systems for emerging use cases such as LLM-based querying, retrieval-augmented 
generation, or persistent memory for agents.
