Hi there, Welcome to my page!  
I'm a 2nd year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo advised by Prof. Semih Salihoglu.
I'm fortunate to be supported by the David R. Cheriton Graduate Scholarship. During my PhD, I have interned at 
Microsoft (Gray Systems Lab). My research primarily revolves around Kuzu, which is a Graph Database Management System 
developed in our research group.  

Research 
==========

For my PhD research, I am mainly exploring query processing for graph databases.
