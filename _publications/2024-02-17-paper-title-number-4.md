Large language models (LLMs) have become essential for applications such as text summarization, sentiment analysis, and 
automated question-answering. Recently, LLMs have also been integrated into relational database management systems to enhance
querying and support advanced data processing. Companies such as Amazon, Databricks, Google, and Snowflake offer LLM 
invocation directly within SQL, denoted as LLM queries, to boost data insights. However, open-source solutions currently
have limited functionality and poor performance. In this work, we present an early exploration of two open-source systems
and one enterprise platform, using five representative queries to expose functional, performance, and scalability limits
in todayâ€™s SQL-invoked LLM integrations. We identify three main issues: enforcing structured outputs, optimizing resource
utilization, and improving query planning.
